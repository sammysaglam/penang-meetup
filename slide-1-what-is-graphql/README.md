## Some advantages of GraphQL

- Reduced requests
- Give power to the frontend dev
- Power of entities instead of BFF (backend for frontend)
- You have now typed-out your API!

## GraphQL isn't really a REST alternative

It's supposed to be just a layer in between in your backend & frontend:

- No assumption of underlying technology
- It's just documenting your business
